## Project Details
### Details
This project consists of a creation of a Web CRM system for Dentists, having Java as a Backend, and full storage of information at a Database. This software has two main views: one that goes through the Administrator of the system, and another one that should be user by the Dentist itself.

The Dentist is able to check the past and future appointments of each specific Customer by using its Social Security Number (CPF in Brazil). It's also able to check the history of its own appointments, as well as the future. Finally, there's an interface to its schedule for the day.

The Administrator, however, has more capabilities. When logged, it can create a new Administrator, if needed. After that, it's possible to Create a new Dentist (filling its personal and account informations) or modify one, after searching by it's registry number. It can, finally, register new Customers. Once a customer is registered, it's possible for the administrator to make some operations with them: Schedule a new appointment at the dentist, by date or by preferred dentist, over a list of available spots; Check its history; Edit information of this customer.
